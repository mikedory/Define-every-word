# define(@everyword)

## Wait, what?

This is a very simple web app that just grabs the latest word tweeted by <a href="http://twitter.com/aparrish">@aparrish</a>'s <a href="http://twitter.com/everyword">@everyword</a> and shows a definition.

## So I'm a nerd.  Can you tell me the nerdy stuff?

Sure!  This was built with Python on Tornado using Redis as a data store and assuming Heroku for deployment.

## Credits

I took a bunch of hints on how to do the Google dictionary parsing from a script written by [Sridarshan Shetty](http://twitter.com/sridarshan), and [Adam Parrish](http://twitter.coma/parrish)'s [Mimetree](https://github.com/aparrish/mimetree/) is a great into to Redis for this kind of stuff.
